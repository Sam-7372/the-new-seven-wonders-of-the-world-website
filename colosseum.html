                <h1>The Colosseum</h1>
                <p>The Colosseum is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. 
		It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world, 
		despite its age. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in 72 and was completed in AD 80 under his successor 
		and heir, Titus. Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian. The three emperors who were patrons of 
		the work are known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre by later classicists 
		and archaeologists for its association with their family name.
		<br><br>
		The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete. It could hold an 
		estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history, having an average audience of some 65,000; 
		it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous 
		battles, and dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly mock sea battles. The building ceased to be used for 
		entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a 
		religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.

			<li>Made from stone and concrete, this magnificent monument was built with the man power of tens of thousands of slaves.</li>
			<li>To protect the spectators from the blistering sun and heat of Ancient Rome, there was the velarium – an awning that could be pulled over the top of the seating area to provide shade.</li>
			<li>Two-thirds of the colosseum has been destroyed over time – mostly the result of vandalism, earthquakes and fires.</li>
		</ul>
