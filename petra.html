                <h1>Petra</h1>
                <p>Petra was originally known to its inhabitants as Raqmu or Raqēmō, is a historic and archaeological city in southern Jordan. 
		Famous for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit system, Petra is also called the "Rose City" because of the colour of 
		the sandstone from which it is carved; it was famously called "a rose-red city half as old as time" in a poem of 1845 by John Burgon. 
		It is adjacent to the mountain of Jabal Al-Madbah, in a basin surrounded by mountains forming the eastern flank of the Arabah valley 
		running from the Dead Sea to the Gulf of Aqaba. Access to the city is through a famously picturesque 1.2-kilometre-long (3⁄4 mi) gorge 
		called the Siq, which leads directly to the Khazneh.
		<br><br>

		The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC, and the Nabataeans might have settled in what would become the capital 
		city of their kingdom as early as the 4th century BC. Archaeological work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence dating back 
		to the second century BC, by which time Petra had become their capital. The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who invested in Petra's 
		proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major regional trading hub.
		<ul>
			<li>Petra’s centerpiece is the Treasury or Al-Khazneh, a 40 meters high monument with a stunning façade.</li>
			<li>The Treasury is actually a graveyard.</li>
			<li>Petra is home to more than 600 tombs.</li>
